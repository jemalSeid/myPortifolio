      <p class="intro">I am a development agent in plant science by profession. I have worked particularly hard to spread agricultural technology that boost crop yield and productivity in rural communities. I enjoy spending the majority of my time resolving
        people's issues. I believe this is the reason I decided to work as an agricultural development agent. Another example of this is my intention to get a degree in community health. My life's mission is to support those who are in need. "No
        matter how strong you are, two is always better than one," is a proverb that is well-known in our nation. As a result, I think it's crucial that my coworkers and I work cooperatively. This is something I've developed through the course of my
        many years of teamwork.</p>

        <h2>Agricultural Extension Agent</h2>
        <p>I have acquired practical knowledge of a variety of advanced agricultural technologies and practices that raise agricultural output and productivity during my three years of college study. I have undergone skill development, mostly in pre
          and post - harvest programs that can guarantee the farmers' food security.</p>

        <h2>Community health extension</h2>
        <p>I have acquired sufficient knowledge about the field of community health care during my two years of education. frankly speaking, I wouldn't even try to claim to be a doctor, but I do have the knowledge and skills necessary to offer community health extension services. This is implied by my 3.37 overall CGPA. I think that by simply altering our nutrition and leading a healthy lifestyle, we may prevent non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, etc., which are rapidly becoming more prevalent in our community and throughout the world.</p>

      <div class="skill-row3">
        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>I believe I have made a start in realizing my dream. At the University of the People, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science while also enrolling in Diaatech web development courses. The knowledge I have acquired from these online learning institutions and other websites has helped
           me improve my web development skills. As a result, I believe my goal of becoming a web developer has been accomplished.</p>
